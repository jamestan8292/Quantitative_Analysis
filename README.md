# Quantitative_Analysis

This application analyses the risk and return of funds against the S&P 500, using Python Pandas in Jupyter Lab.

Specifically, the implementation app analyzes four investment options for inclusion in client portfolios. With the app, one can determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.
